Colliander, A., M. Mousavi, J.S. Kimball, J.Z. Miller, M. Burgin. (2023). Spatial and Temporal Differences in Surface and Subsurface Meltwater Distribution over Greenland Ice Sheet using Multi-Frequency Passive Microwave Observations. Remote Sens. Environ. (Under Review).

Files:

empirical_LWC_profile_map_GrIS_230323_RSE.m generates Figures 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.

Transect_GrIs_SMAP_AMSR2_MultiFreqMapPaper_230330.m generates Figure 5.

Transect_GrIs_AMSR2_AC_plotX_timeseries_MultiFreqMapPaper.m is used by Transect_GrIs_SMAP_AMSR2_MultiFreqMapPaper_230330.m.

Output:

empirical_LWC_profile_map_GrIS_230323_RSE.m creates greenland_snow_status_index_profile_v1.mat which can be found at Colliander, Andreas (2023), “Greenland Snow Status Profile”, Mendeley Data, V1, doi: 10.17632/b5n4k9zkrk.1
